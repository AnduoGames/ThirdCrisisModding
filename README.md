# ThirdCrisisModding

Requirements for C# modding:
- A bought copy of Third Crisis ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260820/Third_Crisis/) | [Itchio](https://anduogames.itch.io/third-crisis) | [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/third_crisis))
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- .net 2.1 installed


Clone the repository, open the .sln. You will need to tell Visual Studio where 2 dll files that come with the game are located. These dll files can be found in your game installation Third Crisis\ThirdCrisis_Data\Managed
- Assembly-CSharp.dll
- UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
- UnityEngine.PhysicsModule.dll

Once this is done, you can Press F7 to build your mod dll. To find your dll, navigate to your cloned repository and go to 
TCModExample\obj\Debug\netstandard2.1

Now open Third Crisis.
Go into the Game settings and turn on the console. You can now open it by pressing F2. Enter the command modmenu.
Export an empty mod manifest by pressing the button. Save it next to your dll.

Next, open your manifest.json and change the PathToDLL to the name of your dll file.

Now, back in Third Crisis, you can open your manifest.json file and your dll file will be loaded by the game!
Happy modding!
